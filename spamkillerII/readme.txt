Purpose:

This program use some tricks for obfuscate the mail address
or plain text from the avid eyes of the spam bots...
They navigate the web throught the research of mail addresses
and than send the resul to spammers ... GET RID THEM!


We can obfuscate our mail changing the reppresentation of
the plaint text using charcodes.. simple, but we
can also use scripting for generating the mail
stored ina crypted form..

WRITE YOUR OWN SCRIPT OBFUSCATOR AND BUILT IN IT IN
THE PROGRAM!

Html browser understand our directive (Script and Plain Html)
and show the correct text when an user open our page.

p.s.

Rename SpamKillerII.___ to SpamKiller.Exe
for use the precompiler Program or
compile it by yourself.



Some Notes About The Program:


By Default the program consider the text inserted
as the text part of a generic

<a href="mailto:">mailaddress@where.domain</a>

example:

yoymail@domain.it


became:

<a href="mailto:&#121;&#111;&#121;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#100;&#111;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#110;&#46;&#105;&#116;">&#121;&#111;&#121;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#100;&#111;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#110;&#46;&#105;&#116;</a>


- if You Select The option

"Consider as Text"

In this case "Obfuscate" process consider the obfusched
text as a generic ascii text and convert it
as a html text field (<p> </p>).

Example:

YOUR TEXT

became:

<p>&#89;&#79;&#85;&#82;&#32;&#84;&#69;&#88;&#84;</p>


I hope the program is simple to use and undestrand in the concept and code.
